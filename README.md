**iPhone|Lovers** blog website is developed using Django Framework as part of Portfolio Project 4 for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.

It targets the most loving series of the iPhones as worldwide people like iphones as lot, where user can view the blog post of their favourite iPhone model, they can comment about a particular iPhone model even if they are not iPhone lovers but they want to give some sort of feedback about the smartphone what they like, they do a blog post and comments. When the user is logged in, user can like/unlike a post, comment on a post and add a post from the user page.

You can view the live site here:-  https://iphonelovers-1bcbfe91e39d.herokuapp.com//
