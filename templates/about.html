                <p> Back in 2007/2008 Apple gave a big surprise to the world by launching an iPhone, at that time it was beyond the imagination
                    the smartphone Apple introduced. Let's read a bit of history ...In 1999, Apple CEO Steve Jobs envisioned an Apple touchscreen 
                    product that the user could interact
                    with directly with their fingers rather than using a stylus.[citation needed] The stylus was a
                    common tool for many existing touchscreen devices at the time including Apple's own Newton, launched
                    in 1993. He decided that the device would require a triple layered capacitive multi-touch touch
                    screen, a very new and advanced technology at the time. This helped with removing the physical
                    keyboard and mouse, the same as was common at the time for tablet computers, human machine
                    interfaces and point of sale systems. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the
                    idea as a side project. When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its user interface, he saw the
                    potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone to compete with already established brands
                    in the then emerging market for touch screen phones. The whole effort was called Project Purple 2
                    and began in 2005. Apple purchased the "iphone.org" domain in December 1999.</p>
